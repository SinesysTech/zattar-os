# Gemini Project Context: Sinesys

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Sinesys project, its architecture, and development conventions to be used as instructional context for Gemini.

## 1. Project Overview

**Sinesys** is a full-stack legal management application for the law firm **Zattar Advogados**. It appears to be a comprehensive internal tool for managing cases, clients, hearings, and other legal data. A key feature is the automated data scraping from the PJE (Processo Judicial Eletrônico), a Brazilian electronic court system.

### Core Technologies

-   **Framework:** Next.js v16 (using App Router)
-   **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
-   **Backend-as-a-Service:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth)
-   **Caching:** Redis (ioredis) using a Cache-Aside pattern
-   **Database (secondary):** MongoDB (for specific features like "timeline")
-   **Data Scraping:** Playwright and Puppeteer
-   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose
-   **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI, generated from JSDoc comments.

### Architecture

The project follows a well-defined, modular architecture:

-   `app/`: Contains the Next.js App Router structure.
    -   `(dashboard)/`: Protected routes for the main application interface.
    -   `api/`: REST API endpoints that serve as the presentation layer for the backend logic.
-   `backend/`: A dedicated directory for core business logic, decoupled from the Next.js API routes. It's structured with `services` (business logic) and `persistence` (database access) layers for each feature.
-   `components/`: Reusable React components, with `components/ui` housing the shadcn/ui elements.
-   `lib/`: Shared utility functions and clients for Redis, Supabase, etc.
-   `supabase/`: Contains database migrations and schema definitions.
-   `scripts/` & `dev_data/scripts`: Various utility, testing, and data population scripts written in TypeScript and executed with `tsx`.

## 2. Building and Running

### Development

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

-   **Local Build & Run:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```
-   **Docker:** The recommended way to run all services together.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### API Documentation

The interactive Swagger API documentation is available at `/docs` when the development server is running:
`http://localhost:3000/docs`

## 3. Development Conventions

### Code Style & Quality

-   **Linting:** ESLint is configured. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues.
-   **Type Checking:** TypeScript is used with `strict` mode enabled. Run `npm run type-check` to verify types.
-   **Naming Conventions:**
    -   **Files:** `kebab-case.ts`
    -   **React Components:** `PascalCase.tsx`
    -   **Variables/Functions:** `camelCase`
    -   **Types/Interfaces:** `PascalCase`
    -   **Database Columns:** `snake_case`

### Key Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
-   `npm run build`: Creates a production build.
-   `npm run lint`: Runs the linter.
-   `npm run type-check`: Runs the TypeScript compiler for type validation.
-   `npm run test:api-*`: A suite of scripts in `package.json` to test the PJE data scraping APIs (e.g., `npm run test:api-audiencias`).
-   `npm run sincronizar-usuarios`: A utility script to synchronize users between Supabase Auth and the public `usuarios` table.

### API Development

-   API logic is defined in the `backend/` directory and exposed via simple handlers in `app/api/`.
-   Endpoints are documented using JSDoc with `@swagger` annotations.
-   Responses follow a standard format: `{ success: true, data: {...} }` for success and `{ error: "..." }` for failures.

### Component Development

-   The project uses **shadcn/ui**. New components should be added via the CLI: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]`.
-   A powerful, reusable `TableToolbar` component exists at `components/ui/table-toolbar.tsx` for pages with data tables, providing integrated search and filtering.
